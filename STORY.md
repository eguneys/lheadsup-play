Is poker a game of skill? Certainly it's a better game than chess for average people, because you can blame your losses on luck and get away with it. But what if you want to improve and get really good? Let's calculate that using a simulation.

I love chess and lichess. And I've always wanted a similar platform for poker. Poker but without the gambling and money. Just for viewing your stats and measuring your skill. My main concern is to draw attention and get people to actually spend their time on this poker site without actually gambling for money. My other concern is poker sites are illegal in my country.

One solution to draw attention is building an AI so it can play with the few people interested in the site to keep them entertained. In this article, I discuss my journey building a poker site, a poker playing AI using neural networks, and dealing with various challenges along the way.

In the past, I've studied how [lc0](https://lczero.org/) works, but never fully understood how the training data, weights of the network transferred between different systems and assembled. The C++ code was not implemented for tensorflow backend. Currently it is implemented, and now I have a more clear picture of how it works. Finally I will also share my conversations with ChatGPT that greatly speeded up my progress.

lc0 is an open source chess engine that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search and neural networks. It has two main parts, [the main engine lc0](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0), written in C++, is a UCI Chess Engine. Given a position, it starts a Monte Carlo Tree Search, and evaluates the leaf nodes by asking the neural network. The neural network is trained to take a position as input and output an evaluation that is a number. Actually there's more to it [as explained here in detail](https://lczero.org/dev/wiki/technical-explanation-of-leela-chess-zero/). Finally the main engine, also generates training data for the neural network to train. Training data consists of a position, and it's evaluation. This data is generated by the main engine by making the engine play a match between 2 MCTS. So MCTS uses the evaluation given by the neural network to generate the training data, that also consists of evaluation of a position, for the neural network. As the evaluation of a position gets more accurate through the MCTS, which means the quality of the training data gets more and more accurate. Considering the fact that in the beginning the evaluation of a position by the neural network was random. We will return to this later, now let's return back to poker.
