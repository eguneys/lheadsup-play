## Review 

In our [first article](STORY.md) we have introduced our journey to an advanced Poker AI, by asking if Poker is a game of skill? We mentioned our interest in chess and lichess as an open platform and building a similar site for poker. Then, mentioned how [lc0](https://lczero.org/) chess engine can guide us through building an advanced Poker AI using reinforcement learning.

Next we built a poker logic, and a naive way to evaluate poker hands.

Next we tried to set a baseline for measuring the skill, by building a Texas Hold'em Headsup Poker Tournament. We established poker players that use simple strategies like always folding, always calling, or always raising. Then we setup a benchmark to measure and display some statistics of the tournament.

Next we discussed our first attempt at building a Poker AI using Monte Carlo Tree Search with the help of ChatGPT. And our concerns about how to evaluate the terminal situation of a poker round.

Finally we mentioned the performance bottleneck of calculating the hand strengths of a player at various stages of a poker round. Then we entered the area of neural networks by introducing two warmup tasks that would ease this bottleneck.
